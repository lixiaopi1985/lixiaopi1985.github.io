To further understand how the whole endophyte communities may involve the tolerance of large samples, we extracted DNA from healthy leaf tissue of previously identified 28 tolerant (T), 41 moderately tolerant (M), and 21 susceptible (S) English boxwood plants, then sequenced associated bacterial and fungal amplicons using the Nanopore MinION platform. The endophyte community did not differ in diversity among the T, M, and S plants but differed in the abundance of bacteria and fungi, particularly between T and S samples. The bacterial genera Brevundimonas and Ammonifex had higher relative abundance in the T and M communities than in the S community, in which the fungal genera Botrytis and Thermothelomyces and family Chaetomiaceae were more dominant. The same results were obtained when mother and daughter samples in the T community were compared with controls in the S community, suggesting bacteria as a work force in the T community. Cooccurrence network analyses revealed that the T network had more fungal hubs but was less complex, with more positive connections than the S network, suggesting that the T community was supported by a healthier network. The resistance of English boxwood to blight is likely attributed to bacteria dominance and a synergic community network. This study is foundational to constructing synthetic communities and using whole communities of tolerant plants through vegetative propagation for microbe-modulated immunity.","tags":["Disease suppressive soil","soil bacterial community","urban garden","boxwood","biological control agents","Nanopore MinION sequencing"],"title":"Leaf endophyte community composition and network structures differ between tolerant and susceptible English boxwood","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoping Li","Olanike Omolehin","Ginger Hemmings","Tsien Tzer Tseng","Amanda Taylor","Chad Taylor","Ping Kong","Margery Daughtrey","Douglas Luster","Fred Gouker","Chuanxue Hong"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Geocaulosphere soil that remains associated with the tuber after harvest is called tare soil. However, beyond potato pathogens, the microbes present in tare soil are understudied. We used internal transcribed spacer and 16S metabarcoding to characterize the microbial communities present in 130 tare soils of commercially produced seed potato plantlets used for potato production in Oregon. In 2018 and 2019, tare soils were opportunistically sampled from seed potato plantlets that were collected from farmers in the Columbia Basin of Oregon. This sampling effort included seed tubers of 23 cultivars that had originated from 40 commercial seed farms in 11 states. We identified a core microbiome consisting of 61 bacterial and 26 fungal taxa, some of which are not common to the potato microbiome, and others which have been reported to either possess biocontrol activities, promote plant growth, or cause disease in potato. Seed grower farm accounted for the greatest amount of compositional variation among tare soil microbiome samples, with more similar communities found on seed tubers grown on farms near to each other. Learning which factors shape tare soil microbial community composition and whether those communities influence plant health are essential steps towards potato microbiome management.","tags":["Plant Microbiome","fungi","bacteria","core microbiome","Solanum tuberosum","Rhizosphere","Geocaulosphere","Tare soil","Pathogen","Crop","Amplicon sequencing"],"title":"Characterizing Variation in the Bacterial and Fungal Tare Soil Microbiome of Seed Potato","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoping Li","Tsien Tzer Tseng","Ginger Hemmings","Olanike Omolehin","Chad Taylor","Amanda Taylor","Ping Kong","Margery Daughtrey","Fred Gouker","Chuanxue Hong"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Currently, little is known about the legacy effects of soil fumigation on soil microbial communities and their response to fumigation at the production scale. Here, 16S rRNA gene and internal transcribed spacer amplicon sequencing was used to characterize the bacterial and fungal communities in soils from intensively managed crop fields with and without previous exposure to metam sodium (MS) fumigation. The effect of fumigation history, soil series, and rotation crop diversity on microbial community variation was estimated and the response of the soil microbiome to MS application in an open microcosm system was documented. RESULTS We found that previous MS fumigation reduced soil bacterial diversity but did not affect microbial richness and fungal diversity. Fumigation history, soil series, and rotation crop diversity were the main contributors to the variation in microbial β-diversity. Between fumigated and non-fumigated soils, predominant bacterial and fungal taxa were similar; however, their relative abundance varied with fumigation history. In particular, the abundance of Basidiomycete yeasts was decreased in fumigated soils. MS fumigation also altered soil bacterial and fungal co-occurrence network structure and associations. In microcosms, application of MS reduced soil microbial richness and bacterial diversity. Soil microbial β-diversity was also affected but microbial communities of the microcosm soils were always similar to that of the field soils used to establish the microcosms. MS application also induced changes in relative abundance of several predominant bacterial and fungal genera based on a soil’s previous fumigation exposure. CONCLUSIONS The legacy effects of MS fumigation are more pronounced on soil bacterial diversity, β-diversity and networks. Repeated fumigant applications shift soil microbial compositions and may contribute to differential MS sensitivity among soil microorganisms. Following MS application, microbial richness and bacterial diversity decreases, but microbial β-diversity was similar to that of the field soils used to establish the microcosms in the short-term (","tags":["Soil microbiome","Soil health","Fumigation","Metam sodium","Disease management","Sustainable agriculture","DNA metabarcoding","Illumina MiSeq"],"title":"Legacy effects of fumigation on soil bacterial and fungal communities and their response to metam sodium application","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoping Li","Ping Kong","Margery Daughtrey","Kathleen Kosta","Scott Schirmer","Matthew Howle","Michael Likins","Chuanxue Hong"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

This study aimed to characterize the soil bacterial community in these boxwood gardens. Soil samples were taken from one garden in California, Illinois, South Carolina, and Virginia and two in New York in early summer and late fall of 2017 and 2018. Soil DNA was extracted and its 16S rRNA amplicons were sequenced using the Nanopore MinION® platform. These garden soils were consistently dominated by Rhizobiales and Burkholderiales, regardless of garden location and sampling time. These two orders contain many species or strains capable of pathogen suppression and plant fitness improvement. Overall, 66 bacterial taxa were identified in this study that are known to have strains with biological control activity (BCA) against plant pathogens. Among the most abundant were Pseudomonas spp. and Bacillus spp., which may have contributed to the Cps decline in these garden soils. This study highlights the importance of soil microorganisms in plant health and provides a new perspective on garden disease management using the soil microbiome.","tags":["Disease suppressive soil","soil bacterial community","urban garden","boxwood","biological control agents","Nanopore MinION sequencing"],"title":"Characterization of the Soil Bacterial Community from Selected Boxwood Gardens across the United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Xiaoping Li"],"categories":["Nanopore Sequencing","Microbiome"],"content":"Nanopore MinION flowcell is a sequencing device smaller than your cellphone, while more expensive (you are looking at $700-$900 a piece).

First, open the priming port cover and make sure there are no air bubbles in the duct (if there are any, suck the bubbles out following the instructions). Second, load 800 ul of the priming mix through the priming port slowly and steadly with a pipette. Third, open the SpotON cover, this is where you are going to load your libraries into. Fourth, Load another 200 ul of the priming mix through the priming port. Fifth, load your library dropwisely to the SpotON port. Sixth, put the covers back on, and you are good to go! Here is a video for loading library: YouTube.\n  The flowcell connects to the MinKNOW software that you use to control the sequencing process. The MinKNOW software interface is very clean and simple to use.\n  Cons\n The storage of flowcell is short, only for 3 months, therefore you need to plan the sequencing carefully. During sequencing, the heat produced by the flowcell and other chemical reactions will induced bubbles on the sensor array, which will jeopardize the longevity of the flowcell inevitably. Therefore, the longer the sequencing time, the more bubbles you would observe in the sensor array. And these bubbles can not be removed through following washing steps. Although the MinION interface is simple and easy to navigate, it could be problematic when it connects to GUPPY software, a gigantic helper for faciliate basecalling using GPU powers. Because certain MinKNOW version is only compatible to certain GUPPY version, you need to keep up with the software updates and with some hacking skills in Linux environment to twitch it. These are not done automatically. I hope Nanopore can integrate GUPPY GPU to the MinKNOW software.  Overall, MinION is a convenient and light weight sequencing devise suitable for many research scenarios.

SSG is a potent biological control agent. Even though its survival on the leaf surface declined rapidly, SSG provided extended, moderate plant protection from a broad spectrum of pathogens. This study used Arabidopsis Col-0 and its mutants, eds16-1, npr1-1, and pad4-1 as model plants and compared treated plants with non-treated controls to elucidate whether SSG triggers plant defense priming. Only eds16-1 leaves with SSG became purplish, suggesting the involvement of salicylic acid (SA) in SSG-induced priming. cDNA sequencing of Col-0 plants and differential gene expression analysis identified 120 and 119 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at 6- and 24-h post-treatment (hpt) with SSG, respectively. Most of these DEGs encoded responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli or stresses; four DEGs had more than two isoforms. A total of 23 DEGs were shared at 6 and 24 hpt, showing four regulation patterns. Functional categorization of these shared DEGs, and 44 very significantly upregulated DEGs revealed that SSG triggered various defense priming mechanisms, including responses to phosphate or iron deficiency, modulation of defense-linked SA, jasmonic acid, ethylene, and abscisic acid pathways, defense-related gene regulation, and chromatin modification.

In the present study, we investigated the transcriptional effect of depriving Shewanella oneidensis cultures of background levels of radiation by growing the cells in a mine 655 m underground, thus reducing the dose rate from 72.1 to 0.9 nGy h-1 from control to treatment, respectively. RNASeq transcriptome analysis showed the differential expression of 4.6 and 7.6% of the S. oneidensis genome during early- and late-exponential phases of growth, respectively. The greatest change observed in the treatment was the downregulation of ribosomal proteins (21% of all annotated ribosomal protein genes during early- and 14% during late-exponential) and tRNA genes (14% of all annotated tRNA genes in early-exponential), indicating a marked decrease in protein translation. Other significant changes were the upregulation of membrane transporters, implying an increase in the traffic of substrates across the cell membrane, as well as the up and downregulation of genes related to respiration, which could be interpreted as a response to insufficient oxidants in the cells. In other reports, there is evidence in multiple species that some ROS not just lead to oxidative stress, but act as signaling molecules to control cellular metabolism at the transcriptional level. Consistent with these reports, several genes involved in the metabolism of carbon and biosynthesis of amino acids were also regulated, lending support to the idea of a wide metabolic response. Our results indicate that S. oneidensis is sensitive to the withdrawal of background levels of ionizing radiation and suggest that a transcriptional response is required to maintain homeostasis and retain normal growth.","tags":["Natural ionizing background","RNAseq"],"title":"Transcriptome analysis reveals a stress response of Shewanella oneidensis deprived of background levels of ionizing radiation","type":"publication"}]
